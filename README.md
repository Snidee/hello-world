# hello-world
Just another repository 

Hi guys !

This is my first read me file on github,
looking forward to working on many open source projects like carla to get 
a better understanding of how programming is changing our world for the better. 
I am a Double major in Finance and Insurance and Risk Management with a minor in math, 
and truly excited for the future to come. I truly do love what I do and I look forward 
to contributing to github over the next many years to come. 

Thank You, 
Zane Benz
